# Terminal keyboard

A terminal piano!

# Requirements

I use SFML on a OSX machine.
On how to install SFML: [https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-osx.php](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-osx.php) .

# Build and run

Given that you have installed the required SFML library:

```bash
make
./keyboard
```

You need to enable terminal to listen to keyboard presses.

# Usage

Keys on a QWERTY keyboard:
O changes octave +
P change octave -

In piano terms:
white note are ASDFGHJK
blak ones are WETYU
